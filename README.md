## How to Use
If you're not me, the main way to use is this:
1. Find a folder named after something you want to learn about, and click into it
1. Read the folder's readme to find a list of resources to look at
1. If you're interested in a resource but want to make sure it's worth your time, look for my notes in that folder about that resource. I'll have a tl;dr section for any resource I've completed reading/watching through.

If you are me:
1. I'm not gonna say cuz I should know, *Danielle*
